CCE Under Non-Random Heterogeneity (with Joakim Westerlund, in The Econometrics Journal)

In panel data regression models, it is often not reasonable to expect all cross-sectional units to have identical responses to explanatory variables, or that all relevant variables have been properly accounted for. These concerns have recently motivated the use of interactive effects models with heterogeneous slopes. The workhorse of this literature is the common correlated effects (CCE) approach, which assumes that both effects and slopes are randomly distributed. The current paper argues that the restrictions implied by this assumption are likely unreasonable in many applications, and that there is a need to allow for non-random heterogeneity.

Some highlights of the paper and implications in economics:

1)  In this paper, we address an issue that we believe is highly relevant in economics.

2) We estimate a panel data model that not only allows for interactive effects but also accommodates non-random heterogeneity.

3) Interactive effects are a generalization of fixed effects. 

4) non-random heterogeneity implies that slope coefficients can vary over unknown groups.

5) Failing to account for interactive effects or non-random heterogeneity can compromise inference. 

6) We employ a machine learning technique to estimate this model in our study. 

7) The assumptions are suitable for both micro and macro data, presenting significant potential for empirical economics research. 

8) Given the method's generality and computational efficiency, we believe it can be used in numerous applications to uncover the heterogeneity of coefficient estimates while accounting for unobserved factors in the errors.
